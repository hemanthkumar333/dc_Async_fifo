# dc_Async_fifo

◦ Designed a 32-bit asynchronous FIFO with 256-depth, featuring Pessimistic Full and Empty Flag generation
◦ Implemented Gray code Encoding & 2-flop synchronizers to prevent multi-bit transitions & metastability
◦ Verified design using ModelSim with 50 MHz write and 30 MHz read clocks under 512-burst input conditions
